# **1)Pizza-Sales-performance-analysis**
I Worked on an Pizza sales Dataset from kaggle, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft SQL Sever was used for data cleaning and preprocessing and Microsoft Excel for Visualization. In this pizza sales performance Analysis report i provided insights like:

    2.Sales by category and size.
    3.Top 5 best and worst sellers(products with highest and lowest sales and revenue generators).

# **2)Ecommerce Sales Analysis Dashboard**

This repository contains a dynamic Excel dashboard for analyzing ecommerce sales data. The dashboard provides insights into sales performance over time using Year on Year Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). It also utilizes slicers for filtering data based on year, region, and segment.

### Project Learnings
- **Data Cleaning with Power Query:** I learned how to clean and transform data using Power Query in Excel.

- **Pivot Table Creation:** I gained knowledge on creating pivot tables to summarize and analyze data.

- **Pivot Chart Creation:** I learned how to create different types of pivot charts to visualize data effectively.

- **Slicer Usage:** I explored the use of slicers in Excel to provide interactive filtering options for the dashboard.

### Insights from the Project

The dashboard provides the following insights:

- **Sales and Profit Analysis:** Get a comprehensive overview of sales and profit performance.

- **Category-wise Profit:** Analyze the profitability of different product categories.

- **Category-wise Sales Share %:** Understand the contribution of each category to overall sales.

- **Sales by State:** Identify sales trends and patterns across different states.

- **Top 5 Subcategories by Sales:** Discover the top-performing subcategories based on sales.

# **3)HR Attrition Excel Project**

I am excited to share the insights from my recent HR Attrition Excel project. This project involved analyzing attrition key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total employees, attrition rate, department, job roles, work distance, and business travel. I also created interactive pivot tables and slicers to explore attrition factors based on age group, gender, education, and job satisfaction.

Here's a glimpse into the project process:

**1. Data Gathering:** I obtained comprehensive HR data from Kaggle, including employee demographic details, work-related metrics, and attrition flags.

**2. Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Using Excel's powerful Power Query tool, I cleaned and prepared the data. I retrieved and grouped the required data, applied conditional formatting, and removed duplicate rows to ensure data accuracy.

**3. Data Analysis & Visualization:** I utilized Excel's Pivot tables to analyze the data and calculate attrition rates. I explored relationships between different factors and represented them visually in an interactive manner.

**4. Dashboard Design:** I designed an organized layout for the dashboard, arranging the visualizations to provide a clear overview of attrition insights. 
This HR Attrition Excel project provides valuable insights into attrition within an organization. By leveraging Excel's powerful features, I was able to uncover patterns and relationships that can inform decision-making and talent retention strategies.
